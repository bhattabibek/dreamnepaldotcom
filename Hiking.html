It is about an hour drive on a local bus. Even though being very close to the capital city, the people here in Panauti have been able to protect their traditional culture here.<br> If you visit Panauti, you will get to observe that people here are still living a typically traditional lifestyle. Mostly the people of Newar community reside in this area since the ancestral time. <br>Apart from that, there are other community people like Tamang, Magar and few Aryan communities as well. People mostly cultivate potatoes, corn, and soybean in this locality. People make a special type of liquor at their house. If you want to try the homemade liquor then, you can try it. Mostly, the Tamang people make it.</p>
      The most unique thing about this town is that people strongly believe the town stands on one single rock and thus, is not affected even when there the occurrence of a disaster like an earthquake.<br>
      People here have preserved the culture and tradition in a very sensitive way. In every 12 years, there occurs Fair (Nepali word Mela). This happens in the temple and the devotees from almost every part come here. They take a bath in the river, which flows in between the temple. All in all, Panauti is a very beautiful place to visit and look at the culture as well.<br>
      Namo Buddha, the name itself says that there must be something related to Lord Buddha. And, certainly, there is, a well preserved and beautiful Monastery situated on the top of the hill. The monastery area is such a peaceful area that, you even feel the positive vibes have been flowing all around the monastery area. <br>The monks here pray and chant Mantras and devote themselves fully. It feels so reviving to see the monks. If you listen carefully through your soul then, you might get some kind of spark hit on your head. <br>It fulfills the empty soul. Thus, most people love to visit Namo Buddha. The surrounding is so peaceful and you are not allowed to make noises. You can take pictures outside the Gumba but not allowed to take pictures or even a camera inside the Monastery. Surrounded by the trail of the forest, situated on top of the hill and peacefully located are enough reasons to visit Namo Buddha.<br>

Moreover, it has the clean surrounding,  <br> scattered crowd yet very warm and welcoming environment.

People cultivate potatoes, corn, soybeans, wheat, etc. They even prepare the homemade liquors out of it. So, we suggest you try it once.  <br>

Nowadays this place is a very popular destination for Homestay tour.  <br> The village gives a very scenic view while you reach there as well as gives the equally stunning view on your way.
