<br>
<b>Travel insurance</b>
<p>Travel insurance is mandatory for all our travelers and should be taken out at the time of booking.  Your travel insurance must provide cover against personal accident, death, medical expenses and emergency evacuation. We also strongly recommend the insurance cost should cover cancellation, curtailment, personal liability and loss of luggage and personal effects. You must provide your travel insurance policy number and the insurance company's 24-hour emergency contact number on the first day of your trip; you will not be able to join the trip without these details.  If you have travel insurance connected to your credit card or bank account please ensure you have details of the participating insurer, the insurance policy number and emergency contact number with you rather than the bank's name and credit card details.</p>
<br>
<b>Flexibility</b>
<p>You appreciate and acknowledge that the nature of this type of travel requires considerable flexibility and you should allow for alternatives. The itinerary provided for each trip is representative of the types of activities contemplated, but it is understood that the route, schedules, itineraries, amenities and mode of transport may be subject to alteration without prior notice due to local circumstances or events.</p>
<br>
<b>Change of itinerary</b>
<p>While we endeavor to operate all trips as described, we reserve the right to change the trip itinerary (if any unavoidable circumstances arise). </p>
<b>Before departure:</b>
<p> If we make a major change, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible if there is time before departure. The definition of a major change is deemed to be a change affecting at least one day in five of the itineraries. When a major change is made you may choose between accepting the change, obtaining a refund of money paid on the land portion of the trip only or accepting an alternative tour offered.</p>
<b>After departure:</b>
<p>We reserve the right to change an itinerary after departure due to local circumstances or events outside of our control.   In such emergency circumstances the additional cost of any necessary itinerary alterations will be covered by you. Please note we are not responsible for any incidental expenses that may be incurred as a result of the change of itinerary such as visas, vaccinations or non-refundable flights.</p>
<br>
<b>Authority on tour</b>
<p>Our trips are run by a tour manager. The decision of the tour / trekking leader is final on all matters likely to affect the safety or well-being of any traveler or staff member participating in the trip. If you fail to comply with a decision made by the tour / trekking leader, or interfere with the well-being or mobility of the group, the tour / trekking leader may direct you to leave the trip immediately, with no right of refund.  We may also elect not to carry you on any future trips booked. You must at all times comply with the laws, customs, foreign exchange and drug regulations of all countries visited, and you also agree to travel in accordance with our responsible travel guidelines. </p>
<br>
<b>Acceptance of risk</b>
<p>You acknowledge that the nature of the trip is adventurous and participation involves a degree of personal risk. You will be visiting places where the political, cultural and geographical attributes present dangers and physical challenges greater than those present in our daily lives. We use information from government agencies and reports from our own contacts in assessing whether the itinerary should operate. However, it is also your own responsibility to acquaint yourself with all relevant travel information and the nature of your itinerary. You acknowledge that your decision to travel is made in light of consideration of this information and you accept that you are aware of the personal risk attendant upon such travel.
</p>
<br>

  To the fullest extent permitted by law:
  - any liability for any loss, death, injury or damage which you may suffer (directly or indirectly) in connection with or arising out of your participation in a trip, or any breach of the Booking Conditions, is excluded;

  - any condition or warranty which would otherwise be implied by law into these</p>
  <br>
  <b>Optional activities</b>
  <p>Optional activities not included in the trip price do not form part of the trip or this contract. You accept that any assistance given by your group leader or local representative in arranging optional activities does not render us liable for them in any way. The contract for the provision of that activity will be between you and activity provider. </p>
  <br>
  <b>Claims & complaints</b>
  <p>If you have a complaint about your trip please inform your group leader or our local representative at the time in order that they can attempt to rectify the matter. If satisfaction is not reached through these means then any further complaint should be put in writing to us within 30 days of the end of the tour.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Severability</b>
  <p>In the event that any term or condition contained in these Booking Conditions is unenforceable or void by operation of law or as being against public policy or for any other reason than such term or condition shall be deemed to be severed from this contract or amended accordingly only to such extent necessary to allow all remaining terms and conditions to survive and continue as binding.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Photos and marketing</b>
  <p>You consent will be asked before using images of you taken during the trip for promotional purposes. </p>
  <br>

  <p>Any personal information that we collect about you may be used for the purpose associated with the operation of the trip. The information may be disclosed to service providers or other suppliers to enable us to operate the Trip. </p>
